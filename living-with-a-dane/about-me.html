                <h2>I am a lover of Great Danes</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole.</strong>I have always had pets growing up as a child and my love for them has grown into my adulthood even more. I have a passion for learning and understanding all different types of animals, especially Great Danes My experience in Pet Care is from having my own pets and caring for family, friends and volunteering over the years.</p>
                
                <h3>I have a Great Dane Rescue</h3>
                <p><strong>You can't buy happiness, but you can rescue it.</strong>We work tirelessly to rescue animals from suffering on the streets or in our high kill shelters.  We provide life-saving medical care and give them a safe loving foster until we can find them a forever home.</p>
                
                <h3>You speak dog better than you think you do.</h3>
                <p><strong>Love is a four-legged word.</strong> You may not be fluent; that would require actually being a dog. But if you went to live in a dogs-only world, you’d be pretty good at understanding what they’re saying. You can tell a nervous yip from a menacing growl, a bark that says hello from a bark that says get lost. You can read the body language that says happy, that says sad, that says tired, that says scared, that says Please, please, please play with me right now!</p>
