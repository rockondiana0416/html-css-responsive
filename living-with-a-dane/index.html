                    <p class="article-body">These gentle giants, which can grow to be the size of a small horse, are loving, loyal, and wonderful additions to families. They’re also alert guard dogs, intimidating in both sound and stature. </p>

                        <p class="article-body">The extra-large size is, hands down, this breed’s defining feature. Great Danes’ height spans 28–32 inches at the shoulder, and their weight falls between 110–175 pounds. The “Apollo of dogs” is also recognizable by its long, narrow, rectangular head, deep-set eyes, and thoughtful expression. They are a very regal dog. They are strong and powerful, and they have a great temperament overall. </p>

                        <p class="article-body">The Great Dane temperament is simply delightful. These dogs, which are of average intelligence, sociable, gentle, friendly, and loving, enjoy spending time with families of all sizes, as well as other dogs and cats, especially when raised with them. Are Great Danes good with kids? The answer, is a resounding yes, although supervision is always a good idea for small children, simply to avoid them being stepped on.</p>

                        <p class="article-body">As social dogs, Great Danes prefer to spend time around humans and other animals rather than in solitude. A large yard is a definite perk for exercise, allowing them to stretch their lumbering legs as desired. But it’s not mandatory, as long as they get the exercise they need. They are big, so they’re going to need to get out and run a little bit, but they are not these dogs that have boundless energy. They like to hang out on the couch a lot of the time.”</p>
